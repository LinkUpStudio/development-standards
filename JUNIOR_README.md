# Junior README

Here are some rules that will keep you _(and all of us)_ out of trouble.

## No `git add .`

Consider this command **forbidden**, as this is how you accidentally add garbage
to your code or mess the whole thing up.

Instead, perform `git diff path/to/single/file`, and then when you're good with
the changes perform `git add path/to/single/file`.

## No `git push -f` (`git push --force`)

This is a dangerous and destructive command and is only allowed for senior devs.
So unless you're a git PRO, and you truly know what you're doing - consider this
command **forbidden**.
